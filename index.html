      <h1>What are Emperor Penguinsüêß ?</h1>
      <h2>Emperor Penguin</h2>
      <h3>Aptenodytes forsteri</h3>

      <h4>
        The emperor penguin is the tallest and heaviest of all living penguin
        species and is endemic to Antarctica.
      </h4>
      <p>
        The male and female are similar in plumage and size, reaching 100 cm (39
        in) in length and weighing from 22 to 45 kg (49 to 99 lb). Feathers of
        the head and back are black and sharply delineated from the white belly,
        pale-yellow breast and bright-yellow ear patches.

        Like all penguins it is flightless, with a streamlined body, and wings
        stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Its diet
        consists primarily of fish, but also includes crustaceans, such as
        krill, and cephalopods, such as squid. While hunting, the species can
        remain submerged around 20 minutes, diving to a depth of 535 m (1,755
        ft). It has several adaptations to facilitate this, including an
        unusually structured haemoglobin to allow it to function at low oxygen
        levels, solid bones to reduce barotrauma, and the ability to reduce its
        metabolism and shut down non-essential organ functions.
